# Steam Librarian
A Steam library manager for the command line

## Why?

I tried using Steam ROM Manager on my Steam Deck but its godawful UI, the multitudes of bugs, and its abandonware nature made it impossible to keep using it.

## Usage

Steam Librarian needs a library JSON file to work off of, and you'll have to create one before you can use this app for realsies.

To do that, run `librarian prepare -l steamlibrary.json`.
